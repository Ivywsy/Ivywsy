### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub 😄

My name is [Ivy Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivy-wusumyi/). I am a data-savvy person and also a postgraduate student who is currently studying MSc Business Analytics at the University of Bath School of Management. I was a project management professional and started my journey as a data analyst since 2021! 

I am interested in storytelling with data and actively look for ways to understand what data is. I have always believed that data analytics is important for every business by uncovering hidden patterns and insights - and probably get every answers from it 💬.
