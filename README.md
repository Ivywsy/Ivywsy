### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub 😄

My name is [Ivy Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivy-wusumyi/). I am a data-savvy person and also a postgraduate student who is currently studying MSc Business Analytics at the University of Bath School of Management. I was a project management professional and started my journey as a data analyst since 2021! 

I am interested in storytelling with data and actively look for ways to understand what data is. I have always believed that data analytics is important for every business by uncovering hidden patterns and insights - and probably get every answers from it 💬.

### My Recent Projects

|  Previews | Descriptions |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| <a href="https://github.com/Ivywsy/NYC-2013-Flight-Departure-Delay-Analysis"><img src="/images/NYC.png?raw=true" width="550"/></a>  | [2013 NYC Flight Departure Delay Analysis](https://github.com/Ivywsy/NYC-2013-Flight-Departure-Delay-Analysis)<br/>Utilised <b>R</b> and <b>Tableau dashboard</b> to visualize the New York city flight dataset in 2013 and gain insights regarding how to improve departure delay, which is one of the most addressed problems faced by all stakeholders within the supply chain of air travel.|
| <a href="https://github.com/Ivywsy/EDA_ggplot2"><img src="/images/EDA.png?raw=true" width="550"/></a>  | [Data Analysis With Visualizations (ggplot2)](https://github.com/Ivywsy/EDA_ggplot2)<br/>Created <b>data visualizations</b> with <b>ggplot2</b> in <b>R</b> to <b>reveal the initial patterns and characteristics</b>  of a dataset. The process of exploration involves identifying the presence of outliers, the distribution of data values, the structure of the dataset and the relationships between different data variables. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Ivywsy/K-Means-Clustering"><img src="/images/Clustering.png?raw=true" width="550"/></a>  | [K-means Clustering to understand naturally occurring clusters among smartphone users](https://github.com/Ivywsy/K-Means-Clustering)<br/>Built <b>K-means clustering</b> models (unsupervised machine learning) in <b>R</b> to <b>uncover subpopulation structures</b> in the data. This analysis is powerful in extracting insights from data and aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of smartphone users. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Ivywsy/Random_Forest_Classification"><img src="/images/RandomForest.png?raw=true" width="200"/></a>  | [Random Forest Classification to predict smartphone users' gender](https://github.com/Ivywsy/Random_Forest_Classification)<br/>Utilised <b>tidymodels</b> in <b>R</b> to build <b>Random Forest Classification</b> (supervised machine learning) models to understand and <b>predict</b> the <b>future customer behavior trends</b>. |
| <a href="https://github.com/Ivywsy/Batch-time-series-forecasting-with-cross-validation"><img src="/images/batch_forecast.png?raw=true" width="550"/></a>  | [Batch time-series forecasting with cross validation](https://github.com/Ivywsy/Batch-time-series-forecasting-with-cross-validation)<br/>Utilised <b>cross-validation</b>, <b>automatic ETS and ARIMA modelling</b> in <b>R</b> to batch forecast 130 time-series with error evaluations and model selection strategy.  |
| <a href="https://github.com/Ivywsy/Manual-time-series-forecasting"><img src="/images/manual_forecast.png?raw=true" width="550"/></a>  | [Manual time-series forecasting](https://github.com/Ivywsy/Manual-time-series-forecasting)<br/>Utilised <b>R</b> and <b>ggplot2</b> to generate time series forecasting with <b>regression, ETS and ARIMA models</b> on food glass containers shipments data from January 1981 to June 1991.  |
| <a href="https://github.com/Ivywsy/Ford-Fulkerson-Algorithm-for-Maximum-Flow-Problem"><img src="/images/max_flow.png?raw=true" width="550"/></a>  | [Ford Fulkerson Algorithm for Maximum Flow Problem](https://github.com/Ivywsy/Ford-Fulkerson-Algorithm-for-Maximum-Flow-Problem)<br/>Utilised <b>VBA</b> and <b>user forms</b> in Excel to create a decision making tool to solve the <b>maximum flow problem</b> in a railway network system. |
